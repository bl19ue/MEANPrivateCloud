Private Cloud Infrastructure

•	Created a private cloud infrastructure responsible to provision, deploy and decommission virtual machine in a data center. 

• Integration of private cloud with virtualization to improve performance, increase efficiency thus leveraging the virtualized infrastructure services leading to high availability. 

•	Our main aim was to develop an easier web user interface so that it becomes flexible enough for the user to construct a private cloud.

•	Provide features to create/start/stop/delete virtual machines and view statistics in the form of graphs using VI API and make changes to virtual machines.
